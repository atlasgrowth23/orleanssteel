# Lead Generation System Documentation

## üéØ Lead Scoring Algorithm

The system uses an intelligent scoring algorithm to prioritize construction permit leads based on their potential value to Orleans Steel. Leads are scored from 0-120+ points, with higher scores indicating better opportunities.

## üìä Scoring Components

### **1. Base Construction Value (0-30 points)**
```
Score = min(Construction Value / $10,000, 30)
```
- **$10k project** = 1 point
- **$100k project** = 10 points  
- **$300k+ project** = 30 points (maximum)

*Rationale: Higher construction values typically mean larger steel orders and better profit margins.*

### **2. Permit Type Relevance (0-40 points)**

**HIGH PRIORITY (40 points)**:
- **FENC** - Fencing/Gates (direct product match)
- **MBLD** - Major Building (structural steel needed)
- **RNVS** - Structural Renovation (steel reinforcement)
- **RNVN** - Non-Structural Renovation (roofing/siding potential)
- **ADDN** - Building Addition (framing required)
- **NEWC** - New Commercial (steel construction)

**MEDIUM PRIORITY (25 points)**:
- **ROOF** - Roofing (metal panels/trim)
- **DEMO** - Demolition (often leads to rebuilding)
- **RERR** - Re-roofing (metal roof replacement)

**LOW PRIORITY (10 points)**:
- **HVAC** - HVAC work (equipment supports needed)
- **MECH** - Mechanical (steel platforms/supports)

### **3. Product Category Bonuses**

**Fencing & Gates**: +20 points (direct sales opportunity)  
**Metal Roofing**: +15 points (growing market segment)  
**Structural Steel**: +15 points (core business strength)

### **4. High-Value Project Bonuses**
- **$50k+**: +10 points
- **$100k+**: +15 points  
- **$250k+**: +20 points
- **$500k+**: +25 points

*Rationale: Large projects justify sales effort and often lead to ongoing relationships.*

### **5. Distance Scoring (5-25 points)**

Distance from Orleans Steel (1641 Poland Ave):
- **‚â§ 5 miles**: +25 points (excellent for delivery)
- **6-10 miles**: +20 points (good delivery efficiency)  
- **11-15 miles**: +15 points (moderate delivery cost)
- **16-25 miles**: +10 points (acceptable range)
- **26-35 miles**: +5 points (far but manageable)

*Rationale: Closer projects have lower delivery costs and faster response times.*

## üèÜ Lead Categories & Expected Scores

### **üî• Hot Leads (80+ points)**
- Large structural projects nearby
- High-value fencing/roofing projects
- Major renovations within 10 miles
- **Example**: $500k structural renovation, 3 miles away = 95 points

### **üéØ Warm Leads (50-79 points)**  
- Medium-value relevant projects
- Smaller structural work
- Metal roofing projects
- **Example**: $150k roofing project, 8 miles away = 65 points

### **üìã Cold Leads (20-49 points)**
- Lower-value projects
- Less relevant permit types
- Distant locations
- **Example**: $25k HVAC project, 20 miles away = 28 points

### **‚ùÑÔ∏è Poor Leads (<20 points)**
- Very small projects
- Irrelevant permit types  
- Very distant locations

## üó∫Ô∏è Geographic Targeting

**Orleans Steel Location**: 1641 Poland Ave, New Orleans, LA 70117

**Service Radius Recommendations**:
- **Primary Zone (‚â§10 miles)**: Daily delivery capability
